# About Manoa Dining Delivery

## Background

Meal plans at the University of Hawaii at Manoa come in either 7, 10, 14 or 19
meals a week along with  "meal points", which are essentially cash credits put 
in your account (1 point = $1) that are reloaded once a semester. For students
living at the dormitories, it is mandatory to have a meal plan.

## Problem

Meals do not rollover to the next week if you do not spend them all. Meal
points, however, do rollover to the next semester if you do not spend it all.
By the end of each week, many people have tons of meals left over and are forced
to spend their meals at The Market, an on-campus convenience store, on food they
don't really want. If given the opportunity, many of those people would exchange
their meals for cash.

In addition, many people who are busy studying (or being lazy) would rather have
food delivered to them rather than going all the way to the cafeteria to get
food. If given the opportunity to get food delivered to them for a small amount,
some students would do so.

## Solution

Manoa Dining Delivery is a Meteor application that allows University of Hawaii
at Manoa students to create requests to have food delivered right to their
dorms. The foods come from the two cafeterias on campus: Hale Aloha Café and
Gateway Café. Students living at the dorms will be able to spend their meals
in exchange for cash.

# Installation Guide

First, [install Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/install).

Second, clone the application by invoking the following command 
on the terminal.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/innovation-manoa/manoa-dining-delivery.git
```

Alternatively, you can download it by clicking [here](https://github.com/innovation-manoa/manoa-dining-delivery/archive/master.zip).

Third, cd into the app/ directory and install required packages using:

```
$ meteor npm install
```

Fourth, run the system with:

```
$ meteor npm run start
```

When the application is successfully built, it will appear on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).

# Development History

## Milestone 1: Mockup Development

Milestone 1 started on April 6, 2017 and ended on April 13, 2017. The goals for 
Milestone 1 are managed [here](https://github.com/innovation-manoa/manoa-dining-delivery/projects/1).

The goal of the first milestone was to create mockups of the various pages of 
the application, create a script that would scrape the menu items from both Hale 
Aloha Café and Gateway Café, and to utilize the University of Hawaii CAS
authentication.

### Landing Page

Upon entering the site, the user is directed to the landing page.

### Terms of Use Page

In order to use the application, users must agree to the terms of use, displayed
on the following page.

### Log In Page

This page is used to allow users to login and use the application. Eventually,
this will be change to utilize the UH CAS authentication system rather than this
to allow users to log in.

### Menu Page

## Milestone 2: Collections and Design

Milestone 2 started on April 13, 2017 and will end on April 25, 2017. The goals
for Milestone 2 are managed [here](https://github.com/innovation-manoa/manoa-dining-delivery/projects/2).

The goal of the second milestone is to create various Mongo Collections for the
different features of the application, and to improve the overall design of the
application. 

The creation of the various collections will allow the different features of the
application to function, such as creating requests, displaying requests, and
displaying current items on the menu.
