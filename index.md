# About Manoa Dining Delivery

Manoa Dining Delivery is a Meteor application that allows University of Hawaii
at Manoa students to create requests to have food delivered right to their
dorms. The foods come from the two cafeterias on campus: Hale Aloha Café and
Gateway Café. Eventually, these requirements should be fulfilled in order to 
create a working application:

* Create a form that allows students to request foods from the two cafeterias on
campus
* Develop a page showing all requests that can be fulfilled
* Create a menu page to display the foods currently on the menu at each of the
cafeterias
* Utilize the University of Hawaii CAS authentication system to allow students
to log in and use the application

# Pages

pages are subject to change as development progresses.
